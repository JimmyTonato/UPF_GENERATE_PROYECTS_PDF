These RNA transcripts are not translated into protein, but instead seem to function as regulatory molecules that control the expression of other genes. As part of the international ENCODE consortium, our group has helped catalogue >10.000 of these genes, 99% of which remain completely uncharacterised. 

LncRNAs represent an extremely promising source of new drug targets. The objective of our lab is to develop a new generation of anti-cancer therapies based on designed lncRNA inhibitors. We identify lncRNA targets via in-house developed, interdisciplinary strategies combining bioinformatics with CRISPR-Cas9 genome-engineering tools. 

We can offer a variety of tailor-made projects to interested students. These may be, for example, integrative data analysis to make testable predictions about lncRNA functionality, or creation of pipelines for identification of cancer-causing lncRNAs from our CRISPR screens. 

Previous MSc students have gone on to publish first-author papers based on their MSc thesis, and have successful scientific careers with us and other groups (eg from UPF: Carlevaro-Fita, Pulido-Quetglas, Mas-Ponte, Lanzos – see Pubmed).

Students in our lab get exposed to latest bioinformatic and experimental practices on a daily basis. They get closely mentored and have numerous opportunities to present their work internally. 

Our lab is involved in several international collaborations and consortia, including the International Cancer Genome Consortium (https://www.nature.com/collections/afdejfafdb) and we were recently awarded a prestigious Future Research Leaders grant from the President of Ireland (https://www.sfi.ie/research-news/news/president-higgins-honours/).

In particular, we are interested in deciphering the evolutionary dynamics of animal cell type programs and in reconstructing the emergence of genome regulatory mechanisms linked to cell type differentiation (from transcription factor binding through chromatin states to the physical architecture of the genome). To this end, we apply advanced single-cell genomics and chromatin experimental methods to molecularly dissect cell types and epigenomic landscapes in phylogenetically diverse organisms. We also develop computational tools to integrate these diverse data sources into models of cell type gene regulatory networks and we use phylogenetic methods to comparatively analyse these models. Our recent work has provided the first whole-organism cell type atlases in different species and mapped key regulatory genome features underlying these cellular programs. By sampling additional species and chromatin features at single-cell resolution, we now aim at dissecting the evolution of cell types and their underlying gene regulatory networks.

Javierre,3D Chromatin Organization,Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC),http:www.carrerasresearch.org/,Computational genomics,Dissecting The Role Of Spatial-Temporal Genome Architecture In Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,"Most of mutations and epimutations associated with complex diseases lie in non-coding regions, frequently at regulatory regions, and potentially exert their functions by altering the regulation of the target genes. The vast majority of regulatory elements that regulate each gene in each cell type are uncharted, constituting a major missing link in understanding genome control. We previously developed a new method called Promoter Capture Hi-C (PCHi-C), which allows the pioneer genome-wide systematic identification of the long-range regulatory elements that control more than 20000 genes. Using this method, we connected for the first-time non-coding autoimmune disease variants to putative target promoters prioritizing thousands of disease-candidate genes and implicating disease pathways, quarters of which not previously implicated (Cell 2016). Based on preliminary data recently generated, we hypothese that the novel description of the regulatory elements that control each gene along human B lymphpoiesis could allow to understand the contributions of mutations and epimutations in B cell cancer development and to discover new genes potentially implicated in malignant transformation. First, we are developing a novel experimental and computational methodology to genome-wide detect distal interacting regions of the genome for all genes in rare cell types with an improved resolution. Second, using this new methodology and other omics such as CHiP-seq, RAN-seq and ATAC-seq, we will unravel the dynamic rewiring of promoter interactomes along B cell differentiation. Third, we will link non-coding mutations and epimutations to their putative target genes, describing potential novel genes and gene pathways associated with B cell pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In summary, this interdisciplinary project will provide unprecedented insights into our understanding of how cells decide their identity with an impact on regenerative medicine, autoimmunity, immunodeficiency and B cell malignancies.

Virtually all human pre-mRNAs need to be spliced to become mRNAs. Furthermore, most pre-mRNAs can be spliced into different mRNAs by alternative splicing. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that perturbations in splicing are linked to disease. However, we know little on how the splicing of particular RNAs may be affected, and even less on how a number of splicing changes are coordinated during development or disease. To start addressing this question, we are analyzing WGS and RNASeq data from a number of cancer datasets. Although we are interested in all events of regulated splicing, we pay special attention to those related to the biosynthesis and function of the ribosome. A cycling cell depends on a suitable set of ribosomes to provide the necessary amount of structural and functional proteins before mitosis; paradoxically, making this machinery requires most of the cell's energy (as an illustrative example, a growing HeLa cell is making 1.6 x105 ribosomal proteins per minute). Thus, we expect that fast-growing cell, subjected to a strong selection (such as a tumor cell), will tweak this process to get any advantage. However, the analysis of the transcriptome of ribosomal proteins presents specific challenges because (a), it includes the mRNAs that are most abundant in the cell, but the amounts of each one are variable (while the ribosome has one copy of each protein); (b), the corresponding pre-mRNAs undergo little alternative splicing; and (c), the majority of human pseudogenes come from them, which introduces ambiguity when mapping reads to the genome. Our initial results suggest that processing of this set of transcripts is altered in cancer in unexpected ways, and we plan on strengthening our conclusions by expanding our analyses. In this context there are many opportunities for those with a strong motivation to document genomic strategies that control the tran-scriptome of specific gene families, like those related to the ribosome or the spliceo-some.
The tasks involve quality analysis of raw RNASeq data, mapping using standard tools (for example, Hisat, STAR, and those related to direct sequencing of RNA), statistical analysis (Ballgown, Salmon, Vast-tools, DexSeq, or others), and modeling. Subject to progress, we would explore the use of transcriptomics data as a disease prognosis tool; namely, is a distinct distribution of transcripts indicative of a particular disease out-come?

Because RNA is a single-stranded molecule, it tends to fold back on itself, forming stable secondary and tertiary structures by internal base pairing and other interactions. The function of RNAs can vary depending on the specific folding that the molecule, and therefore accurate RNA structural maps are needed to understand the complexity, function, and regulation of these molecules. Unfortunately, current methods generating RNA structure maps employ second-generation sequencing technologies (e.g. Illumina), which are unable to produce information on highly repetitive regions of the genome. Here we will use Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), capable of producing full-length RNA molecule reads, to produce RNA structure maps for highly repetitive regions, such as those involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD).

Using several genetic markers, such as mitochondrial or Y-chromosome lineages as well as high-throughput SNP coverage of several human populations, we have addressed some demographic questions, from regional aspects such as the genetic impact of the Bantu expansion in Central Africa to more global issues such as the colonization of whole continents.

We have analyzed parts of our genome in order to detect genetic signals yield by selective processes, such as adaptation to different environments and its relationship with human diseases.

Indeed, the growth of biological databases is steeper than ever before, and the repertoire of possible read-outs spans all levels of biology. However, the nature of biological data is remarkably complex, and dealing with diversity, inconsistency and incompleteness, among other issues, demands heavy specialist processing, and prevents a widespread predictive approach to disease biology. Indeed, this deluge of data has not spurred the development of truly precision therapies, and the inherent limitations of the prevailing reductionist approaches have highlighted the need of moving away from the ‘one disease, one target, one drug’ paradigm and consider the complexity of human pathologies and physiological responses.
The current project builds on the hypothesis that the disease-causing perturbations leave detectable traces at different - and variable - levels of biological complexity (i.e. activation/inhibition of signaling pathways, transcriptional changes, etc) that capture both the direct effect of the perturbation and a global reaction of the system. Accordingly, the main aim of the project is to collect genuinely heterogeneous datasets, and offer a generic and intuitive means to bridge the gap between biological big data repositories and state-of-the-art machine-learning tools. Besides, we shall develop a generalized connectivity mapping, as a form of virtual phenotypic screening, to discover novel chemical or genetic modulators able to revert the specific signatures of disease and ‘cancel out’ the phenotypic traits of the disorder.
The successful candidate shall be responsible for the implementation of a pipeline to collect and process biological big data, and to encapsulate it in the form of heterogeneous biological embeddings. Overall, we shall develop a novel strategy to integrate the deluge of biological data in a format that is readily suitable for modern machine learning. Additionally, he/she will develop a General Connectivity Mapping (GCMap) strategy to link biological and chemical signatures from the Chemical Checker (htts://chemicalchecker.org), so that the biological context of each small molecule can be incorporated as a descriptor.

The urge to couple biological data to cutting-edge machine learning has spurred developments in data integration and knowledge representation, especially in the form of heterogeneous, multiplex and semantically-rich biological networks. Today, thanks to the propitious rise in knowledge embedding techniques, these large and complex biological networks can be converted to a vector format that suits the majority of machine learning implementations. Indeed, we have generated biological embeddings (i.e. bioactivity signatures) that capture complex relationships between small molecules and other biological entities such as targets or diseases (Duran-Frigola et al. 2020 Nat Biotechnol). However, only a tiny fraction of the possible chemical space has been so far explored, meaning that most compounds able to modulate biological activities (i.e. drugs) are yet to be discovered. Accordingly, the main objective of this project is to couple our bioactivity signatures to inverse design algorithms to generate new chemical entities with a desired functionality. In particular, we aim at generating new chemical entities (NCEs) to modulate the activity of a specific set of targets, selected from a combination of perturbagen profiles, to revert the pathological state induced by Alzheimer´s disease (AD) and other complex disorders. All in all, the incorporation of machine learning methods to the drug discovery process will trigger the development of thousands of novel compounds, finally enabling precision medicine.

PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) bound to PIWI proteins repress transposon activity in the germline. Repression of transposons is essential for normal progression of mammalian spermatogenesis. Transposons are highly enriched among piRNA producing loci and are transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally repressed by piRNAs. Nearly half of all piRNA-producing loci are protein-coding genes but, to date, it remains unknown why/how certain protein-coding genes are targeted for piRNA production during gametogenesis. The dynamic landscape of mammalian transposon insertions in genes and the strong association between piRNAs and transposons raise the question whether transposon insertions in genes have triggered piRNA production from these genes. 
The goal of this project is to use bioinformatics tools and available data (both from the lab and from other publications) to understand the effect of transposon insertions on gene function in the mammalian male germline. The specific objectives are to understand the extent and genetic causes of inter-individual variation in piRNA expression in mouse and to gain mechanistic insight into piRNA production from protein-coding genes.","Ozata, D.M., Gainetdinov, I., Zoch, A. et al.

For instance, dysbiosis in distinct communities has been related to some diseases. Traditionally, studying these populations required the isolation and culture of each individual microorganism, which is a significant limitation considering that small portion prokaryotes are culturable. However, using sequencing technologies allows the study of these populations in a high-throughput manner. These technologies have been essential for the development of metagenomics, which is defined as the culture-independent genomic analysis of all the microorganisms in an environmental niche.

Human microbiomes are taxonomically different whether they come from the gut, skin, vagina or from the mouth. For instance, the genus Bacteroides is very abundant in the gut while it is Lactobacillus in the vagina. Changes in the normal microbiota composition (dysbiosis) have been linked to some diseases such as diabetes (gut), obesity (gut), autism (gut), fertility (vagina), acne (skin), Parkinson (gut), among others. About 16,000 samples from the American Gut Project (AGP) have been already analysed with Gaia to obtain the taxonomic profile of the samples. Metadata for these 16,000 samples is available. With this taxonomic matrix and the available metadata, the student will develop methods, especially related to machine-learning, that will help doctors to diagnose.

And when variants are located far away from any gene, they are usually assumed to act on the nearest gene, which can often prove totally wrong [2]. 
The regulatory element that can explain this long distance action of the variant on the gene is the enhancer. Enhancers are genomic regions on which transcription factors bind, and which activate the expression of one or several genes by being brought close to (in 3D) the uptream regulatory elements (promoters) of those genes. Enhancers can therefore be far away from the genes they activate on the 1D genome, but being close to them in the 3D space of the nucleus.
Today the best approaches to identify enhancer/gene relationships in the genomes are genetic screening [3] and targeted chromatin structure (3D), such as polymerase II ChIA-PET [4] or promoter capture HiC [5]. The problem is that the first one can only targets a handful of genes and the second one is very difficult and costly to generate. 
For this reason and because many international consortia such as ENCODE, FANTOM or Epigenome Roadmap have recently produced and made publicly available large quantities of functional 1D data (such as RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, histone marks or methylation data), the favoured approach is the integration of high-throuput functional 1D data. 
Although many programs exist to identify enhancer/gene relationships from functional 1D data [6,7,8], there is no consensus about what the best approach is. Here we would like to fill in this gap by assessing the different existing methods on reference sets and proposing a new method that uses a minimal amount of different data.
The student will therefore have to:
- Make a complete state-of-the-art of the existing 1D methods
- Plan the evaluation
  * Define reference sets
  * Define criteria to include programs in the evaluation
  * Define the input data to use for each program to evaluate
- Make the programs to evaluate work on small and real evaluation datasets

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) define the complexity of biological processes in healthy and disease states. Intra-species PPIs describe partially this complexity but symbiotic and pathogenic interactions contribute as well by either benefiting or harming the host. The study of inter-species PPIs are of special interest in the case of pathogens since knowledge extracted from these interactions can lead to new therapeutic targets to avoid their negative effects on the host. There exists an extensive collection of intra-species PPIs enabled by the rapid development of high-throughput experimental technologies. However, experimental identification of inter-species interactions is not simple and computational prediction becomes then necessary (Cuesta-Astroz et al 2018). For instance, we proposed a homology-based prediction method to obtain human-parasite PPIs in 15 parasitic species (Cuesta-Astroz and Santos et al 2019). Additionally, this method incorporated biological context relevant in the parasites' life cycles to obtain accurate spatially-resolved interactions. 
Here, we want to implement a method that benefits from features derived from intra-species interactions to predict inter-species interactions focusing on human-pathogen interactions. The vast amount of intra-species interactions compiled in publicly available databases can be used to train sequence-based classification algorithms that can then be tested in both intra- and inter-species interactions also available in several resources. Furthermore, this method can be improved by annotating the predicted interactions with known biological context such as infection, survival and pathogenic mechanisms.

This project will be carried out in close collaboration with Dr. Yesid Cuesta-Astroz from the University of Antioquia and the Colombian Institute of Tropical Medicine (Medellin, Colombia).","Computational and Experimental Approaches to Predict Host-Parasite Protein-Protein Interactions.

To maintain protein functions during evolution, these properties must be robust to sequence variations (for example mutations). Nevertheless, structural/dynamical changes may be beneficial, for instance if they improve the way the protein functions or generate functional innovations. Understanding this trade-off between structural stability and malleability in evolution is of great interest for fundamental biology and for protein design.
In recent years, we have contributed to better characterize the sequence-structure/dynamics
relationship, particularly in the context of highly-flexible protein regions. We have constructed an extensive database of small fragments involving three consecutive residues (called tripeptides) extracted from coil regions in experimentally-determined protein structures. We have shown that this database is useful to accurately sample the conformational variability of protein loops [1] and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) [2]. We have also developed an approach to characterize the structural preferences of each tripeptide sequence, and we have defined metrics to quantify the structural differences between different sequences.
The goal of this project is to investigate how mutations occurring during evolution affect protein local structural propensities. To do so, the candidate will exploit our structural database and use the developed approaches and metrics. Starting from a set of currently observed proteins, s/he will infer the evolutionary history relating them and will quantify the correlation between changes in sequence and changes in local structures.

Non-vertical evolution might be more restricted in eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes, yet it is not negligible and can be common in certain groups. Recognition of such processes brings about the need to incorporate this complexity in our tools and models, as well as to conceptually re-frame eukaryotic diversity and evolution. In this project you will work on several hybrid genomes, including those of some pathogenic species, using comparative genomics and populations genomics tools.

Despite that modern high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are currently accessible for many labs, the accurate identification and annotation of gene family is one of the major challenges in the field. This scenario will change in the near future thanks to the irruption of the so called third-generation sequencing technologies (i.e., long-read sequencing). In this sense, our research group is generating new high quality genomic data from a group of Canary Island endemic spiders (Chelicerata) using long-read sequencing technologies but also chromosome-scale assembly techniques, such as Hi-C and Chicago libraries. 
The objective of this project is to study the abundance, distribution and evolution of repetitive elements in chelicerates and, by extension, in arthropods, including transposable elements  (TEs) and other types of repetitive sequences. A large body of evidence suggest that these elements have structural functional significance. TEs, for instance, can generate variability by movement and insertion, are responsible of defining centromeric regions, or can activate gene expression under stress conditions. Our bioinformatic study in a comparative context will enable understanding of the nature and behavior of this important  genomic components.

The student will participate in the identification, annotation and/or analysis of repetitive elements in complete genomes of several spiders (and chelicerates) species. For that, he/she will use high quality genome sequences (data generated by our group based on third generation sequencing technologies, and sequences already available in databases), bioinformatics tools (software and scripts to manipulate and visualizte sequences and genomic annotations, to identify repetitive elements, to conduct evolutionary genetics analyses). The basic work-flow will consist in the identification and primary annotation of repeats, the determination of families, types and classes, the estimation of gene turnover rates, or the characterization of the distribution of these repetitive sequences across chromosomes or  with respect to other genomic elements, such as protein-coding genes . Many of these analyses will be carried out in our high performance computer cluster.

While DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes de-methylate DNA, Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) proteins are involved in demethylation. As DNMTs and TETs do not bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner, how these proteins are recruited to their specific sites of action is still an open question. Further, our understanding of the cascading effect of these aberrant DNA methylation patterns on gene expression deregulation is still limited. With a better characterization of the cascading effects of DNA methylation in cancer patients, we could reveal key regulatory networks critical for an improved molecular understanding of the diseases, as we recently showed for breast cancer [3].

In this project, the Master student will perform pan-cancer computational analyses to study the interplay between TF binding, DNA methylation, and enhancer activity. Specifically, the project will aim at (1) unravelling the interplay between DNA methylation and TF-binding in cancer types with limited statistical power and (2) unravelling the interplay between DNA methylation and enhancer activities.

1. We recently computed expression-methylation quantitative trait loci (emQTL) between TF expression and methylation at high-confidence TF-DNA interaction information stored in our UniBind database [4]. emQTL highlighted an interplay between DNA 5mC marks and TF-binding and showed that the binding of key pioneer TFs at their binding sites are likely to trigger local DNA demethylation that could lead to carcinogenesis (unpublished). Unfortunately, the small sample size for some cancer types prohibited the identification of the TFs involved, due to reduced statistical power. The student will use Generative Adversarial Networks (or alike machine-learning approaches) to simulate synthetic data for both methylation and gene expression from available patient data. This approach will alleviate the statistical power bottleneck currently observed. The generated data will be used to perform emQTL analyses and highlight key TFs modulating DNA methylation landscape in these cancer genomes.

2. In the second part of the project, the emQTL framework will be extended to investigate the relationship between DNA methylation and enhancer activity. Specifically, we will use RNA-seq data mapped at enhancers annotated by the FANTOM5 consortium with DNA methylation information from both normal and cancer tissues. The results will be used to investigate how the interplay between DNA methylation, TF binding, and enhancer activity mimics cell fate transition. Indeed, recent reports found that, during cell fate transition, pioneer TFs prime inaccessible enhancers, leading to increased chromatin accessibility and loss of DNA methylation [5].
This project will equip the student with computational biology skills employed in studying gene regulation and cancer genomics. She/he will build computational workflow using Snakemake and scripts in Python, R, and bash. The master student will be introduced to and learn to handle large public cancer genomics data (from ICGC, TCGA, and BASIS) and gene regulation resources (e.g. UniBind, JASPAR).","1.

The machinery engaged in this process, the spliceosome, recognizes conserved nucleotide sequences in the introns in order to promote their excision from the pre-mRNA. Alternative splicing is a process that allows the cells to selectively control which parts of a pre-mRNA will be represented in the mature mRNA to be translated into protein. Despite current knowledge, the mechanism of alternative splicing is still not fully understood. The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a transcription factor (TF) that has recently been shown to be relevant in this process as mutations in its binding site are linked to specific exon inclusion or exclusion [1]. As binding of CTCF to the DNA is altered by DNA methylation [2], the study of the impact of DNA methylation at CTCF binding site on alternative  splicing could shed light on aberrant splicing patterns observed in cancers.

In this project the Master student will explore the interplay between DNA methylation, transcription factor binding and aberrant alternative splicing in cancers. Specifically, we plan to: (1) detect differentially used exons in cohorts of tumor and normal samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC); (2) identify binding sites for CTCF and other TFs in the vicinity of the differentially used exons; and (3) characterize the effects of somatic mutations and DNA methylation at these binding sites on aberrant alternative splicing. Some details are provided below.

(1) The student will use the DEXSeq [3] Bioconductor package on the RNA-seq data from normal and cancer samples to detect differentially used exons. This analysis will be performed on cohorts of samples from TCGA and/or ICGC for which RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and somatic mutations are available. 

(2) In the second step of the project, the student will use our UniBind database of high confident direct TF-DNA interactions [4] and TF binding analyses to highlight binding sites for CTCF and TFs that could be associated with alternative splicing. A strategy similar to what was used by Ruiz-Velasco et al. [1] for CTCF will be implemented.

(3) In the final step of the project, the candidate will combine information from (1) and (2) to overlay somatic mutation and DNA methylation at TF binding sites with the observed alternative splicing events in cancer patients.

This project will consolidate the student’s knowledge in computational biology for the analysis of genomics data with a focus on gene expression regulation and cancer. Moreover, the student will get familiar with large cancer genomics public data sets available at TCGA and/or ICGC. She/he will learn how to develop computational workflow to analyze large-scale data, such as differential exon usage and differential methylation analyses. The student will also be exposed to different programming languages such as R, Python, and Bash.

For the vast majority of computational analyses, the two copies of each chromosome are combined. However, it is generally known that many biological processes can show differences between the two copies of the chromosomes. A specific gene can for example be expressed from only one of the two chromosomes (allele-specific expression). Or, genetic mutations in tumour samples occur on only one of the two chromosomes (heterozygous mutations).  In our group, we aim to distinguish information of the different copies of the chromosomes to better understand the development of cancer. We will do this in the context of lymphomas, which are tumours that originate from normal immune cells.

While the chromosomes are considered linear structures, they are actually folded at the three-dimensional (3D) level in a highly organised way (Dekker et al. Nat Rev Genet. 2013). This organisation is needed for the chromosomes to regulate gene expression. Importantly, in lymphoma cells the 3D chromatin structure is altered in comparison to normal cells (Vilarrasa-Blasi & Soler-Vila et al. BioRxiv 2019). In our group, we aim to study the 3D chromatin structure in lymphoma cells in comparison to normal cells. More specifically, we study how genetic translocations (=a piece of one chromosome fuses to another chromosome) in lymphoma cells affect the 3D chromatin structure.

In this project, we will use Hi-C data generated to study the 3D chromatin structure in normal cells (Rao et al. Cell 2014) and lymphoma cells (Vilarrasa-Blasi & Soler-Vila et al. BioRxiv 2019 and unpublished data). Hi-C is a molecular technique coupled to next generation sequencing that allows to reconstruct the 3D folding of the genome in the nucleus (Lieberman-Aiden et al. Science 2009). 

First, we will computationally separate the two homologous copies of chromosome 14. We focus on this chromosome as in lymphomas one of the copies of chromosome 14 is affected by a genetic translocation we aim to study. More specifically, we will use the variation in the genetic code between the two copies of chromosome 14 to distinguish them. To that end, we will use the genomic sequencing data of this chromosome in these samples and perform a de novo assembly to create a reference sequence for the two copies separately. Next, we will use this reference sequence to map the Hi-C reads representing the 3D chromatin structure to one or the other chromosome. Finally, we will reconstruct the 3D-chromatin structure using these separated sets of reads in TADbit (Serra et al. PLoS Comput Biol. 2017). From these reconstructed copies of chromosome 14 we will analyse the differences in the 3D chromatin structure in order to understand the effect of this genetic translocation specific to lymphoma on the 3D chromatin landscape surrounding it.

The student is expected to develop computational tools that strengthen a multidisciplinary team of bioinformaticians, physicists and experimentalists and that provide us with unique capabilities to resolve molecular structures. 
The biological question that we would like to address is exocytosis, a cellular process responsible to deliver biomolecules to the plasma membrane and extracellular space that is conserved in all eukaryotic cells. Exocytosis controls the growth of cell surface and it is directly coupled with the cell cycle and viability. However, the mechanism that regulates exocytosis is a central question in cell biology that could not be answered yet. Decades of research and the latest developments in gene editing, molecular biology and cryoEM have provided fundamental insight about exocytosis, but failed to resolve the molecular details that control this essential process. The complexity of the protein machinery involved and fast cycles of assembly-activity-disassembly have prevented full understanding of exocytosis. Recently, we developed a new method of fluorescent microscopy capable of resolving the 3D architecture of protein assemblies directly in living cells. Using this approach and computational integration of structural data we reconstructed de novo the exocytic machinery at the nanometre scale (Picco et al 2017 Cell). However, high-resolution structures and conformational dynamics necessary to understand the mechanism of exocytosis remain elusive.
We offer a position for a Master student to push further integrative structural biology and that, together with our collaborators (D. Davos, CABD, Sevilla; J.

They include diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus and inflammatory bowel disease. They cause a significant reduction in the quality of life of many patients and a significant increase in comorbidities. In the last decade there has been a big increase in number of therapies available to treat ADs. However, these therapies only work for a subset of patients and, in many cases, after a period of time their efficacy diminishes. In our group we are convinced that one solution to this major health problem would be the use of drug combinations. By identifying pairs of drugs that synergize their effect we could provide a more powerful therapy. The present master’s thesis project is focused in this interesting research problem. To do so, the student will use single cell RNA-seq data on tissue and immune system cell samples, and different statistical and data mining tools to identify the most likely drug combination for a specific autoimmune disease.

For example, methods involving counting cells of microscopic algae are being replaced by metabarcoding: a short region of the gene (rbcL) coding for the large subunit of RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, the key enzyme of photosynthesis) is amplified from environmental samples and sequenced by Illumina; the reads are processed through a bioinformatics pipeline, where they are filtered to remove sequences containing errors, and then identified to species by reference to a database of known ‘barcodes’ from Sanger sequencing. Although these pipelines work adequately, some of the methods used to reject ‘faulty’ sequences are crude. For example, sequences that occur only rarely in a dataset are often rejected because of the error rate in Illumina sequencing, which leads to incorrect nucleotides occurring ±anywhere along a sequence. A threshold is therefore set, that a particular sequence must be observed twice or more times before it is accepted as real, on the basis that any particular error during sequencing is unlikely to occur many times repeatedly. The proportion of reads rejected on this basis can be of the order of 50% and probably involves many type II errors in the quantification of diversity. 
The suggested project would involve developing a method that is able to assess HTS reads, even when the sequences have never been encountered before (and are therefore not in the reference database), by taking account of the fact that RuBisCO (like all proteins) has a function and that function can only be performed if the protein folds in the correct way. Hence certain changes in the DNA coding for RuBisCO are evolutionarily ‘easy’ (because they have no effect on protein function, e.g. many codon 3rd position changes), whereas others are strongly or fully constrained. The project aims to determine the likelihood of different changes at a particular DNA site by evaluating variation among known rbcL gene sequences in the group of organisms being studied and also considering RuBisCO structure (which is well-known ), and to use this information to develop an ‘intelligent filter’ for metabarcoding pipelines. In this, reads would be evaluated on the basis of whether they code for biologically plausible peptides, rather than solely on the basis of their frequency. Though applied to rbcL, the approach developed could be applicable with appropriate modification to any coding sequence used for metabarcoding (e.g. the CO1 gene used to barcode animals).",,"Bioinformatics pipeline development, protein structure prediction, programming, sequence alignment","HTS, protein sequence, environmental DNA, microalgae",No,To be discussed,"This project would require a combination of skills from different areas of specialization in the syllabus, mainly from computational genomics and structural bioinformatics, and include the need for some programming."

To address this question, we use large-scale transcriptomic analysis and latest single-cell sequencing technologies combined with methods development to study gene expression, splicing and cell type composition variation across human tissues and phenotypes. 
In this project, we will perform a large-scale analysis of splicing variation between individuals with different phenotypes and from different ethnic groups. In previous studies, we observed that variation in splicing may play in contrast a comparatively greater role in defining individual phenotypes than variation in gene expression. contributes more to individual variation than to changes in gene expression (Melé et al.

Moreover, we observed an enrichment of specific genes showing large splicing variation between individuals that was especially strong for ribosomal proteins and that will be explored further.

The lab is interested in understanding how individual variation in gene expression can explain phenotypic differences between individuals both in the context of health and disease. To address this question, we use large-scale transcriptomic analysis and latest single-cell sequencing technologies combined with methods development to study gene expression, splicing and cell type composition variation across human tissues and phenotypes. 

In this project, we will perform a large-scale analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets across tissues to address how individual variation in gene expression can explain phenotypic differences between individuals. First, we will analyze hundreds of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets to explore the impact of aging, smoking, gender and certain disease conditions to changes in gene expression and cell type composition in blood. Second, we will use cell type deconvolution methods to map single-cell signatures in expression data across many tissues from individuals with different conditions including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Overall, this project will explore in depth what is the role of gene expression and cell type composition in defining why human individuals are different from one another and how this impacts disease progression. 

What you will learn: Development of computational pipelines to analyze and interpret large datasets specially from single-cell RNA-seq, and bulk RNA-sequencing. Working in a high performance computing (HPC) environment. Interpret multi-omics data, working through scientific collaboration, effective communicating research, writing scientific articles and critical thinking.

Alternative splicing (AS) is a molecular process allowing multiple transcripts to arise from the same gene. The power of AS in expanding the functional potential of a gene is well exemplified by the axon guidance receptor Dscam in Drosophila melanogaster. Dscam produces ~38000 distinct transcripts, which uniquely fine-tune the function of the gene in different neurons. AS contributes to functional diversity not only within cell populations but also between cell types/tissues. Our lab is currently investigating the role of AS in the evolution of animal tissue diversity: here we propose a parallel analysis of AS evolution in vertebrates and insects, two monophyletic clades in the bilaterian tree.
 
Set up: we inferred exon orthology groups in a set of 20 bilaterian species (8 vertebrates, 8 insects and two pairs of relative outgroups) and we assembled a comprehensive RNA-seq dataset covering 8 homologous tissues in all species. We used the RNA-seq data to identify AS exons within each species and tissue.
 
Experimental design: the project will be divided into three main parts:
1) We will investigate evolutionary patterns involving the entire tissue AS landscapes. Preliminary results show that neural and muscle AS networks seem to be well conserved in vertebrates but not in insects, suggesting different rewiring rates between the two clades.
2) We will focus on the exons specifically spliced within each tissue. Many tissue-specific exons have acquired tissue-specific regulation millions of years after their birth. An exciting perspective is the identification of a causal relationship between changes in exon regulation and simultaneous phenotypic innovation/adaptations.
3) We will explore the regulatory mechanisms underlying the rise of tissue-specific AS.
 
The master project will be developed as part of this bigger project on exon evolution. The student will become familiar with the principles of alternative splicing and gene regulation, while getting hands-on experience with genome annotations, RNA-seq data analysis, comparative transcriptomics, and network reconstruction.","- Torres-Méndez, A., Bonnal, S., Marquez, Y., Roth, J., Iglesias, M., Permanyer, J., Almudí, I., O’Hanlon, D., Guitart, T., Soller, M., Gingras, A.-C., Gebauer, F., Rentzsch, F., Blencowe, B.J.B., Valcárcel, J., Irimia, M.

Recent studies suggest some of these transcripts translate peptides that can be presented by MHC molecules and be an important source of neoantigens. Such neoantigens are non-self proteins and could thus trigger a potent immune response and be very relevant for immunotherapy approaches to fight against cancer. However, the lack of studies measuring novel transcriptional events in cancer prevents us from fully understanding the contribution of these neoantigens.

The aim of the project will be to perform transcriptome assembly directly from RNA-Seq data using large publicly available cancer cell datasets. In the group we have previously employed massive transcriptomics data to identify recently originated transcripts in human and mouse and predict any encoded protein products (Ruiz-Orera et al., 2015; Ruiz-Orera et al., 2018).

Our laboratory has particular interest for years in the study of a particular histone variant called macroH2A (2). Histone variants replace canonical histones in a sub-fraction of the core structural units of chromatin, the nucleosomes.  Recently, we demonstrated surprising impact of macroH2A on nuclear organization and  heterochromatin architecture (3).  The proposal of this master project is to investigate the role of macroH2A and other heterochromatin regulators, through the integration of the data created by our laboratory (Hi-C, HiChIP, ChipSeq, RNAseq) with those present in public databases.

Specifically, we will address the following questions:
1. To evaluate association of macroH2A with respect to self-interacting genomic regions such as topological associated domains (TADs) and genome compartments.
2. To modify a framework of our previously created tool (regioneR (4)) to allow its application in a three-dimensional genomics context.

While methods that work with Illumina short reads are quite mature, the development of software to work with Nanopore RNA sequencing reads is a very active area of research. We and co-workers have recently developed a method to build transcriptomes from RNA-derived Nanopore reads (cDNA and direct RNA)  that does not require a reference genome and that could be used to investigate highly rearranged genomes (such as those in cancer cells) or species that currently lack a sequenced genome (de la Rubia et al., 2020).

We would like to determine when it is more convenient to use one sequencing technology over the other one, and if the combination of the two tecnologies – using Illumina reads to correct errors in Nanopore reads – is a real advantage.

Biological ontologies, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) (Köhler et al. 2019) and the Gene Ontology (GO) (The Gene Ontology Consortium 2019), are recognized as essential tools in the grand challenge of biomedical data integration and interpretation.
In collaboration with the BSC Computer Science Department, we have developed a system for the efficient traversing and exhaustive path enumeration in interconnected biological ontologies (Cirillo et al. 2019) exerting large-scale parallelism and scalability in High-performance computing (HPC). This framework harnesses machine learning to infer a precise mapping between disease-related phenotypic features and distinct molecular processes allowing knowledge discovery.
The proposed activity will be centered on the application and extension of this framework to a larger set of biological ontologies with the aim to study aspects such as (1) the dynamics of biological knowledge accumulation across time; (2) the integration and reconciliation of the multiple biological ontologies; (3) the implementation of machine learning approaches for biological knowledge representation and reasoning.

Microbial phytoplankton in the ocean fix as much carbon from the atmosphere as land plants, and other heterotrophic microbes guarantee that most of the fixed carbon is circulated through food webs. The genomic machinery that marine microbes use for performing a myriad of metabolic processes remained unknown until ca. 15 years ago, when large-scale DNA sequencing projects became feasible. With the advent of high-throughput DNA sequencing, we started unveiling the ocean microbiome at unprecedented levels of detail. During the last 5 years, very large genomic datasets have been extracted from the global ocean microbiome. In particular, the global expeditions TARA-Oceans (https://oceans.taraexpeditions.org) and Malaspina (http://www.expedicionmalaspina.es) have produced a goldmine of genomic data that we are continuously explored. This data is the best representation we have of the diversity and function of marine microbes, and considers mostly metagenomes and metatranscriptomes (ca. 30 Terabytes of compressed DNA data). My group at the ICM-CSIC (log-lab http://www.log-lab.barcelona at the EMM https://emm.icm.csic.es) is involved in both global marine expeditions. The proposed project aims at interrogating these datasets in order to 1) determine the population variation of selected microbes (using mutations; a.k.a. SNPs or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) in the global ocean and 2) find out whether some of the previous variation is due to evolutionary processes that occurred relatively recently in geological time. For investigating the above, we will build metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and then map metagenomic or metatranscriptomic reads from the global ocean to a number of selected MAGs. Afterwards, we will perform a SNP calling analysis, aiming to determine fine-grained genomic variation. The analysis of these SNPs is what will indicate how much variation is present in the selected microbial populations and whether part of this variation has emerged through adaptive evolution. Most analyses for this work will be performed at our marine bioinformatics platform Marbits https://marbits.icm.csic.es

Antibody developability is defined as the likelihood of an antibody drug candidate with suitable functionality to be developed into a manufacturable, stable, safe, and effective drug that can be formulated to high concentrations while retaining a long shelf-life.

The RRSSalud is a research project that aims at investigating the typology and dynamics of dissemination on social media of fake news in the area of health. By combining quantitative methodologies (statistical analysis and social network analysis) and qualitative techniques (content analysis and focus groups), we explore the attitudes of people regarding the health information they consume. Specifically, we plan to focus on understanding the ability of Internet users to distinguish between false and true content, as well as, the tactics and strategies they use to detect the trustworthiness of news. In addition, topics, morphologies and rhetorical strategies of fake news will be explored. The investigation is coordinated by three teams of researchers from the University of Navarra and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. As a result, we expect to develop tools, methods, and guidelines that can be employed by public health institutions, media organizations, and the general public to counteract the dissemination of fake news.

The incorporation into the language of this neologism is a symbol of a serious current problem: the organized dissemination of false information, mainly through social media, in order to manipulate the public opinion.

This phenomenon, popularly known as false news or ""fake news"" [1], has shown to have a significant impact in multiple areas and situations in recent years. In the political arena, for example, it has been found that it significantly influenced the results of the Brexit referendum and the 2016 presidential elections in the United States [2]. In business, the phenomenon of disseminating hoaxes and biased information has been identified as a way to deliberately discrediting brands and companies [3]. Information on the environment has also been a fertile area of lies and half-truths, especially with regard to the information on climate change [4]. However, the area of health is one of the areas where disinformation can cause profound damages [5], with anti-vax campaigns or health recommendations on epidemic periods to name a few. RRSSalud project focuses on studying fake news in health-care published on social media in Spain.

The aim of the project is to explain the relationship between the vulnerability of Internet users to fake news and the dynamics of propagation and repercussion of these contents on social media. By combining experimental research with quantitative and qualitative methods we plan to explore the phenomenon from a holistic and comprehensive perspective.

Specifically, the goals of the project are: i) identify the typology of fake news in the area of health and disseminated on social media in Spain; i) assess the vulnerability of Spain’s Internet users to fake news; iii) profile population groups in relation to their critical capacity to identify fake news; iv) understand the dynamics dissemination of fake news and propose actions to mitigate its impact; v) identify the subjective aspects that lead to giving credit to fake news and promote its subsequent dissemination by users.","1 Quandt, T., Frischlich, L., Boberg, S., & Schatto ‐ Eckrodt, T.

7000 existing rare diseases (RDs). As 80% of RDs are thought to have a genetic origin,
particular emphasis has been placed on the rapidly expanding development of genomic
technologies. However, the interpretation of the genome is still a real challenge for
molecular geneticists, and innovative bioinformatics solutions combining genomic and
clinical data are crucial for reaching accurate patient diagnosis.
At the CNAG-CRG and in the context of several EU projects (RD-Connect, Solve-RD,
EJP-RD) we developed a data sharing and analysis tool, the RD-Connect Genome-
Phenome Analysis platform (GPAP: https://platform.rd-connect.eu/), to provide methods
and standardised analyses of phenotypic and (gen)omic data in order to facilitate
mutation detection within the context of rare diseases.
As part of the Solve-RD project: “solving the unsolved rare diseases” (www.solve-rd.eu),
rare disease patient data from 19.000 genomic datasets will be reanalysed using the
RD-Connect GPAP. To this purpose, high throughput SNV-indel data (re)analysis
solutions are being implemented in the system to automatically allow real-time queries
to a high number of samples. A first prototype has been built enabling the filtering of
thousands of genomic datasets by specific filters including variant pathogenicity and
population databases.
The master student joining this project will be working on the development of this
innovative approach by improving the tool that queries the RD-Connect API to enable
more complex queries (involve family members’ genotypes, specific regions of the
genome, other individuals with phenotypic similarity, etc.). This work will be done in close
collaboration with clinicians and researchers of four ERNs (European Reference
Networks) involved in the Solve-RD project enabling continuous analysis feedback and

Many proteins remain highly flexible in solution, possibly forming local transient structural elements. These proteins are usually called Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs).  They play crucial roles in multiple biological processes and are directly involved in several pathologies, including cancer and neurodegeneration. The high flexibility of IDPs has notably hampered their study. Experimental biophysics technics such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) provide information on conformational trends [1]. However, the quantitative interpretation of these experimental data requires the use of computational approaches that account for their ensemble averaging properties. These computational approaches are based on the construction of large conformational ensembles. We have recently developed a new method to model conformational ensembles of IDPs [2], which provides a more accurate representation than existing approaches. This method will be of great inserts for the scientific community working on the understanding of IDPs. The goal of this project is to provided easy access to this method through a web server, as we did a few years ago for another molecular modeling application (http://moma.laas.fr) [3]. By the end of the project, aiming to disseminate our work, we plan to submit an article describing the new web server for publication in a high-impact scientific journal.

To do so, we apply state of the art structure-based drug discovery methods, many of which have been developed in-house. We introduced the use of molecular dynamics with mixed solvents (MDmix) for druggability prediction,[1] as a computational counterpart of binding site detection by solvent screening.[2,3] This strategy turned out to be extremely successful and the method became widely adopted, with different adaptations (see reference [4] for a recent review). Since then, we have explored and extended the applicability of the method, describing its relationship with protein flexibility,[5] demonstrating its performance in mapping binding hot spots on protein surfaces and predicting water displaceability,[6] or as a guide in docking.[7] An open-source software was produced to help other users adopting the technique: http://mdmix.sourceforge.net

Some preliminary work indicates that MDmix can also be used in predicting binding free energies of protein-ligand complexes.[7] In this project we will investigate its efficacy in predicting activity cliffs (i.e. pairs of structurally similar compounds presenting large potency difference). In medicinal chemistry, activity cliffs are crucial in systematic structure− activity relationship (SAR) analysis to identify structural modifications that determine SAR characteristics [8]. An analysis of a large set of matched molecular pairs compiled from the literature[4,5] and already available in our lab will be performed, comparing the performance of MDmix with other computational tools. This project is synergistic with other projects in our lab, and will benefit from substantial previous work and of close collaboration with other group members.","J. Seco, F. J. Luque, X.

The candidate will join the area of Precision Medicine in Alfonso Valencia’s Computational Biology group within the Life Sciences Department at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. This research line encompasses the development of different strategies and approaches to improved personalized diagnosis of disease, as well as treatment selection for particular patients, based on their individual characteristics. Computational systems biomedicine relies on the development of in silico models to integrate different sources of experimental information and produce patient-specific mechanistic explanations of cellular behaviour used to design new targeted therapies. In the context of cancer, cell signalling as well as metabolic models have been reconstructed for different cancer types and healthy tissues. Simulation of these models using different computational approaches (e.g. Boolean formalism, Constraint-Based Modelling) have supported the development of targeted therapies that attack specific biological pathways in the cell. 

The candidate will focus on using and further developing a set of tools aimed for the simulation drug inhibitions of different cell lines. These simulations will explore varying concentrations of single drug inhibition and combinations of them.

Scientific context

Discovery of efficient anti-cancer drug combinations is a major challenge, since experimental testing of all possible combinations is clearly impossible. Recent efforts to computationally predict drug combination responses retain this experimental search space, as model definitions typically rely on extensive drug perturbation data1,2. 
Relying on background knowledge extracted from literature and databases, patient-specific dynamical models were developed3 previously tailoring a general cancer model4 to breast-cancer patients.

In this work, the study of solutions of the Boolean model led to identifications of particularities among patients and their clinical stratifications3. Currently, we have used this same framework to obtain prostate-cell-line-specific dynamical models and are starting to perform drug perturbation studies. Nevertheless, due to the limitations of the simulation tools used5,6, this study neither identifies sets of concentrations where this synergy is maximal nor it considers population-level constraints and behaviours. 
In present project, the candidate will simulate varying concentration of inhibitors in the different cell lines model using a multiscale modelling framework, PhysiBoSS7, that that combines agent-based8, Boolean5,6 and environmental dynamics9 modelling.
The candidate will first gather from databases and literature biophysical information on parameters that allows for the tailoring of the multiscale simulation to each cell-line such as uptake rates, growth rates, etc. Then, the use of scripts already in place (in python, bash, perl, R) and new ones developed by the student will allow exploring different concentrations of drugs to find maximal synergies specific for each cell-line that would help identifying drug responses potentially relevant in the clinic.","1.

Although GPCRs have been extensively studied over the past decades, the underlying molecular and structural mechanisms responsible for many critical regulatory processes of this protein superfamily remain elusive.
Understanding the dynamics of receptor functionality is currently a major challenge in molecular biophysics and a requirement for the rational design of drugs with improved therapeutic profile. For this reason, a promising approach to elucidate the molecular basis of GPCR functionality are molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, a potent computational technique capable of generating atomic-resolution simulations of the structural motions of a molecular system. Consequently, MD simulations are increasingly being applied to the study of GPCRs, as reflected by the rapid upsurge of publications concerning this topic.
In view of the growing importance of MD simulations, the GPCRmd project was created with the purpose to build the GPCRmd database, a database of MD simulations of GPCRs capable to foster data from all-over the world (www.gpcrmd.org). This web-based platform provides visualization and analysis tools specifically designed for the evaluation of structural and dynamic data of GPCR family members. 

In this Master project, the student will be involved in the design and development of new interactive analysis tools for the study of GPCRs, which will be incorporated in the GPCRmd viewer webpage. Such analysis tools will be focused on the study of the complex signalling network of intra-protein interactions that ultimately determine the response of the GPCR to a given drug. This includes the automatized detection and classification of different types of relevant interactions, comparison of the interaction network of different receptors (phylogenetically related receptors, wild type vs. mutant, ...), comparison of the network at different stages of a given molecular process, etc. Moreover, the obtained analysis tools will be applied to a case-study with the final aim to better understand how the intra-protein interaction network of a receptor of interest is affected by different stimuli or alterations (binding of a given ligand, receptor mutations, …). 

The student will learn about GPCR biology, protein dynamics and in silico drug design, as well as web development, biomedical data analysis and biological databases. The internship can be extended into a PhD thesis.

We expect that the GPCRmd database will have high impact on GPCR research and the discovery for new drugs. This will be communicated in a relevant publication to which the Master student will contribute.

They are present in almost every type of cell, and govern almost every process in the human body (i.e. cognitive and inflammatory processes or control of the cardiovascular system). Owning to their ubiquity, they are targets of more than 30% of current drugs, and every day new GPCRs are revealed to be pharmacological targets for existing diseases.
GPCR drugs can either be agonist, antagonist or inverse agonists. They act by binding to the receptor and establishing transient interactions with protein residues that form the binding pocket. Those interactions alter the GPCR structure, leading to a specific downstream signalling response. However, important features responsible for a distinct drug profile (selectivity, signalling outcome, etc.) are still unclear. Uncovering those factors would provide important structural insight for further drug-design endeavours. Currently, there exist multiple GPCR structures bound to various ligands (chemicals binding to GPCRs), however a static look at ligand-receptor interactions doesn’t allow to fully rationalize the signalling profile. 

Molecular dynamics (MD) is a novel and sophisticated technique that enables to simulate protein behaviour in a physiological environment. They offer a unique opportunity to study GPCR-ligand interactions at single atom resolution, providing insights on receptor behaviour. The development of MD techniques has been rewarded with a Nobel Prize in 2013, and the number of papers using MD is growing exponentially.

In our group we have carried out a massive MD projects to unravel general principles of GPCR signalling and drug binding. With the aid of an international consortium we have simulated over 90 GPCRs crystallized with diverse ligands, amounting impressive simulation time (www.gpcrmd.org). 

We are looking for a motivated student that would be interested in participating in the analysis of this data. The students would be involved in analysing the generated MD data. During the project they will learn how to set up, and simulate their own biological systems. They will learn about GPCR biology, as well as about in silico drug design. To analyse the data the students will learn to write in house scripts in tcl, bash and python, as well as use several statistical methods. The student will have the opportunity to collaborate with international experts renowned in the GPCR field (members of the consortium see reference).

We expect that the results of the analysis will be published in a high impact journal, and the skills acquired by the student will make him/her a valuable asset for pharma companies. The project can be extended into a PhD thesis.

The Plass lab, located at Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), investigates the role of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in the regulation of cell identity using a combination of computational and high-throughput experimental approaches. In particular, the lab is interested in understanding how RNA processing mechanisms, including splicing and alternative polyadenylation (APA), impact neuronal cell differentiation and how this process is altered in the development of neurodegenerative diseases.
We known that around 70% of human genes are regulated by APA. Despite the growing amount of evidence showing that APA changes according to the proliferation and differentiation status of a cell, it is still not clear if APA contributes to this process and which are RBPs involved.

Goals
The project proposed will focus on developing new computational approaches to identify RBPs involved in the differentiation of neural cell types in single-cell transcriptomics data (scRNA-seq) and characterize their target genes across different cell types. 
During this project, the student will learn how to analyze scRNA-seq datasets using existing tools and will develop new computational methods to identify regulatory interactions in single-cell datasets.

Approach
1.- Characterize cell and tissue specific RBPs
Using a collection of published scRNA-seq datasets, the student will characterize the expression of RBPs across human and mouse cell types from different tissues and differentiation states using existing packages for single-cell transcriptomic analyses. She/he will use these data to make an expression atlas of RBPs and identify cell type and tissue specific RBPs, by comparing the expression of the RBPs across datasets. 

2.- Identify RBPs target genes across cells
Using a combination of published and newly-developed methods, the student will identify RBP-RBP and RBP-target interactions across cell types that could suggest a functional relation. Assuming that we find interactions in which the expression of an RBP affects the expression of a gene, the student will develop a computational method to recover them from single-cell datasets. We will benchmark the method developed by assessing the ability to identify known interactions between RBPs and genes. Next, we will use a computational pipeline developed in the lab (Plass et al. unpublished), that allows quantifying the expression of individual APA isoforms. Using a similar approach as described before, we will now identify robust associations between specific RBP and individual APA isoforms across cells.

3. – Identify RBP – gene/isoform interactions relevant for neural differentiation
The student will use a computational lineage-reconstruction to understand the relationships between different neural cell types in a time-dependent manner, i.e. understand which cell types give rise to other cell types. These methods can also be used to order cells according to their differentiation status. Once she/he has obtained a ordering of cells, she/he will develop a new method to identify interactions between an RBP and a target gene or isoform in time, i.e., identify cases in which the expression of an RBP in time n affects the expression of a target gene/isoform in time n + t. In this way, we will be able to identify new correlations that may be related to the cellular differentiation process.

This small number of effector proteins nevertheless enables a cellular signaling apparatus that is flexible and versatile. Versatility is achieved by modulation at the molecular, spatial, and temporal levels of the macro-molecular interactions at each node in the pathway. In effect, a limited number of nodes, each with several alternative downstream pathways, can give rise to a vast number of distinct signaling pathways. Although versatile and complex, the biological role of signal transduction demands specificity and precision in signaling. In this respect, many questions remain open about the interplay of the molecular, spatial, and temporal levels of the macro-molecular interactions. This knowledge gap is tackled by the European Research Network on Signal Transduction (ERNEST) which counts currently more than 400 researchers with different expertise in the field.

As an example, it is known that genetic variation can affect individual food preferences, which has impact on diet and health. Indeed, genetic sensitivity to bitter taste has been associated to different sensitivity to bitterness and/or linked to variable risk of alcohol dependence, obesity, nicotine dependence, longevity, miocardial infarction, or altered thyroid function (Duffy 2004; Mangold et al 2008; Campa et al 2012; Clark et al 2015). At the molecular level, bitter taste perception in humans is mediated by the 25 members of the Taste 2 receptor (TAS2R) gene family (Conte et al 2002). Each member of the TAS2R family can bind a range of compounds with different specificities, enabling the detection of tens of thousands of bitter molecules (Meyerhof et al 2010 Chem Senses). Therefore, knowing the atomic details of their binding capabilities would be important to understand the impact of these genetic variants in diet preferences and disease risk.
In this project, we aim to contribute to the structural characterization of taste receptors to understand their functional mechanisms and the impact of genetic variants in health. We will model four bitter taste receptors that host variants associated to disease: TAS2R16, TAS2R38, TAS2R42, TAS2R50. Preliminary results using available models at www.gpcrdb.es show that critical residues for function gather around active site. However, these models still contain some structural errors that we will need to refine by molecular dynamics (MD). Then, we will model by docking the binding of around 100 bitter compounds to all TAS2R models and will compare the results with their known specificities (Meyerhof et al 2010). This will help to refine the modeling pipeline and will provide a theoretical framework for TAS2R binding to bitter compounds. We will also explore potential homomeric interactions of TAS2Rs by protein-protein docking in collaboration with Hugo Gutiérrez de Terán (Uppsala University). Finally, in collaboration with the groups of Masha Niv (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) and M. Purificación Fernández Zurbano (ICVV-UR), we will use our molecular models to test candidate compounds that are related to bitterness in wine, in order to build a functional model of taste perception in humans for the interpretation of genetic data affecting taste and hence diet preferences and health.

Those species that can make this proteins do so thanks to special adaptations ('upgrades') of the protein synthesis machinery. Now we want to further develop and use these tools to map the global proteome landscape and identify all possible protein sequences possibly unique to some group of species thanks to the existance of 'upgrades'.

We offer one or two payed (modestly) positions to carry out these analyses. We look for candidates interested in evolution, biochemistry, and confident in the use of R.

Current machine learning techniques are data-hungry and brittle—they can only make sense of patterns they've seen before. Using current methods like reinforcement learning, an algorithm can gain new skills by exposure to large amounts of data, but cognitive abilities that could broadly generalize to many tasks remain elusive. This makes it very challenging to create systems that can handle the variability and unpredictability of the real world, such as domestic robots or self-driving cars. However, alternative approaches, like inductive programming, offer the potential for more human-like abstraction and reasoning. 

The abstraction and reasoning corpus (ARC) provides a benchmark to measure AI skill-acquisition on unknown tasks, with the constraint that only a handful of demonstrations are shown to learn a complex task (https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge). This competition was initially created  by the creator of the Keras neural networks library and it’s explained in this paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547). The idea is to move beyond the competition timeframe to create an AI that can solve reasoning tasks it has never seen before and set up a path toward a PhD in AI. It is expected that novel work in terms of a paper should be produced during this period.

However, overall success rate is less than 10%. Thus, drug repurposing is received much attention and new indications of existing drugs are accounting for 20% of new products. Systematic analyses of thousands of developed/approved drug or compounds have found many with previously unrecognized anti-cancer activity. While these evidence mainly derive from in vitro cellular assays, large-scale studies of population-based health care records integrated into genetic information are currently possible. Preliminary data from our group has discovered that certain drugs used for non-cancer common conditions have large protective effects regarding cancer progression and metastasis.
In this project, we aim to estimate the beneficial effects of common medications on cancer patient survival by integrating and modeling epidemiological and health care data from two European populations. The effects will be further deciphered at the germline genetic level by meta-analyses of GWASs. This proposal is integrated into experimental assays also performed at the recipient group.

Typically, this is applied to analyze the connection between gene expression and cancer progression, therapeutic response or patient survival. This approach has generated hundreds of biomarkers, of which several are nowadays applied in the clinic. However, some genes might not show a single facet during the course of the disease: they can act as tumor suppressors or as oncogenes depending on other variables (so called “Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde” genes). These genes, their features and impact on cancer outcome remain completely unknown.

The secondary but equally fascinating objective is to study the neuroanatomical basis of language using primary progressive aphasia as a “lesion-model.” We hypothesize that specific neuroimaging biomarkers including structural, diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state functional MRI, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography provide measures of brain damage that reflect differentiable pathophysiologic mechanisms. More specifically, we hypothesize diffusion tensor imaging and functional MRI will be able to capture brain damage at early disease stages when volumetric atrophy is not apparent. To this end, we will preprocess and analyze the before-mentioned neuroimaging scans and then apply various statistical methodologies to compare across diagnostic groups and study their association with other biologic and language measures. The data for this study originates from a multitude of past and ongoing projects based at the Hospital Sant Pau Memory Unit.  ","Classification of primary progressive aphasia and its variants.
